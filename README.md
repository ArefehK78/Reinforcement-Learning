# Reinforcement-Learning
Using OpenAi Robotics environment Fetch to train a robot to perform four tasks namely, reaching the end-effor to a goal position, pushing, sliding, picking and placing a puck to defined targets with Reinforcement Learning methods. An off-policy algorithm: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to do this.
